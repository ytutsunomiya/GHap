\details{

The function implements the method of Meyer & Houle (2013) to approximate standard errors and confidence intervals of arbitrary functions of variance components. The method consists in assuming that REML estimates of variance components asymptotically follow a multivariate normal distribution with mean equals to the REML estimates themselves and covariance matrix equals the inverse of the average information matrix. Following that assumption, samples are drawn from that distribution and the user-defined function is applied to the samples. Standard errors are obtained as the standard deviation of the resulting vector, and confidence intervals are derived from vector quantiles.

The user must provide a function of variance components to the fun argument. The function has to be set assuming that the components are stored in a vector named x. For example, if variance components come from an animal model and the user wishes to obtain standard errors and confidence intervals for the heritability,  simply use fun = function(x)\{x[1]/sum(x)\}.
